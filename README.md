iOS 14.5 WebKit/Safari based Jailbreak
Made by RPwnage & the Manticore team
Fork by ConnorFX


My Additions to the Description:
I forked this for learning purposes only, DO NOT expect support to be given to anyone for this fork.
I highly recommend you stay on 13.3 or below if you are on those versions and use Odyssey or Taurine instead of this fork.


Original Description:


* Manticore-Web soon
* Highly WIP
* Current Exploit is only for iOS 14.5+ as it exploits a vulnerability in audioworklet. + also as there is no kernel exploit for 14.4+ yet (however, there are multiple kernel vulnerabilities that may be usable, there just aren't exploits for them yet) this won't work until an exploit is written for one of those vulnerabilities, or he adds a safari webkit exploit for 14.4.2 and lower, which will make it work on 14.3 and lower which currently have cicuta_virosa.
* Credits for the [Webkit exploit](https://twitter.com/pwn_expoit/status/1395941530808905729?s=21)
